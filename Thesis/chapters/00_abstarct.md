# Abstract {-}

This thesis develops a coupled combustion–heat-transfer–hydraulics model for a three-pass fire-tube industrial shell boiler and evaluates its performance under realistic operating conditions. The modelling framework integrates (i) detailed fuel-air combustion with temperature-dependent thermophysical properties obtained from Cantera, (ii) six sequential gas-side heat-exchange stages representing furnace radiation, convective tube banks, reversal chambers, and a downstream economiser, and (iii) a water/steam circuit governed by saturated boiling in the pressure parts and single-phase heating in the economiser. The gas–water energy balance is solved using a one-dimensional marching algorithm, which updates local heat-transfer coefficients, wall temperatures, and segmental duties based on a full resistance network combining convection, radiation, fouling, and conduction.

Combustion calculations provide the adiabatic flame temperature $T_\mathrm{ad}$, the fully burnt flue-gas composition, and the total heat release $Q_\text{in}$ from the lower heating value of the supplied natural-gas fuel. Hydraulic losses are resolved concurrently using friction-factor and minor-loss correlations applied to each stage, yielding a complete gas-side pressure-drop profile. Boiler-level performance metrics—including useful heat transfer $Q_\text{useful}$, direct and indirect efficiencies, stack temperature, and the decomposition of radiative and convective duties—are obtained after convergence of a fixed-point iteration that links assumed efficiency to the resulting steam mass flow.

Sensitivity studies quantify the influence of excess-air ratio $\lambda$, drum/feedwater pressure, and firing rate on thermal performance, heat-transfer distribution, pressure drop, and steam capacity. The results demonstrate that efficiency exhibits a shallow optimum near the design excess-air setting; that pressure chiefly affects steam quantity rather than boiler efficiency; and that firing rate scales heat duties approximately linearly within the practical load range. The modelling framework provides a physics-based tool suitable for analysing industrial shell-boiler behaviour, supporting performance evaluation, operational optimisation, and design exploration.
