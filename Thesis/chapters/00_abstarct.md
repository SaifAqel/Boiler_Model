# Abstract {-}

This thesis develops a coupled combustion–heat transfer–hydraulics model for a three pass fire tube industrial shell boiler and evaluates its performance under realistic operating conditions. Implemented in Python, the modelling framework integrates (i) detailed fuel-air combustion, (ii) six sequential gas side heat exchange stages representing furnace radiation, convective tube banks, reversal chambers, and economizer, and (iii) a water/steam circuit governed by saturated boiling in the pressure parts and single phase heating in the economizer. The gas–water energy balance is solved using a one dimensional marching algorithm, which updates local heat transfer coefficients, wall temperatures, and segmental duties based on a full resistance network combining convection, radiation, fouling, and conduction.

Combustion calculations provide the adiabatic flame temperature, the fully burnt flue gas composition, and the total heat release from the lower heating value of the supplied natural gas fuel. Hydraulic losses are resolved concurrently using friction factor and minor loss correlations applied to each stage, yielding a complete gas side pressure drop profile. Boiler level performance metrics, including useful heat transfer, direct and indirect efficiencies, stack temperature, and the decomposition of radiative and convective duties, obtained after convergence of a fixed point iteration that links assumed efficiency to the resulting steam mass flow.

Sensitivity studies quantify the influence of excess air ratio, drum pressure, and firing rate on thermal performance, heat transfer distribution, pressure drop, and steam capacity. The results demonstrate that efficiency exhibits a shallow optimum near the design excess air setting; that pressure chiefly affects steam quantity rather than boiler efficiency; and that firing rate scales heat duties approximately linearly within the practical load range. The modelling framework provides a physics based tool suitable for analyzing industrial shell boiler behavior, supporting performance evaluation, operational optimization, and design exploration.
