# Backup / Q&A bank (not slides)

1. **Why model six stages instead of a single UA?**

- Stage geometry and regimes differ (radiation in HX1 vs convection in HX6).
- Needed to reproduce duty redistribution with \(\lambda\), fouling.  
  Support: _“Boiler configuration”_, _“Heat-transfer model”_, stage-wise figure.

2. **How is the water/steam mass flow determined?**

- Outer fixed-point loop between efficiency guess and \(\dot m*w\) from \(\dot m_w= \eta Q*\mathrm{in}/(h*g-h*\mathrm{in})\).
- Iterate until \(|\Delta \dot m*w|<10^{-3}\) kg/s.  
  Support: *“Sanity checks / validation posture”\_ (verbal), thesis Ch. 7 procedure.

3. **Why compute two flue-gas representations (equilibrium vs fully burnt)?**

- Equilibrium (HP) gives \(T\_\mathrm{ad}\) with dissociation.
- Fully burnt “frozen” set gives stable property evaluation for HX/hydraulics.  
  Support: _“Model architecture”_, thesis Ch. 4.

4. **What dominates heat transfer in the furnace?**

- Radiation contributes strongly at high \(T\); modeled via gray-gas bands.
- HX1 duty is largest (2.86 MW in control case) and mostly radiative.  
  Support: _“Gas/water properties + radiation handling”_, _“Control case”_.

5. **Where does most gas-side pressure drop occur and why?**

- Economizer dominates due to crossflow bundle losses (drag-based).
- Control case \(\Delta P*g \approx 12.45\) kPa, with HX6 contributing most.  
  Support: *“Hydraulics”_, _“Control case”\_, stage summary table in thesis.

6. **Why is efficiency optimum near \(\lambda\approx 1.05\)?**

- Higher \(\lambda\) increases flue mass flow and sensible stack losses.
- Lower \(\lambda\) reduces excess air margin; optimum balances losses vs temperature level.  
  Support: _“Parametric trends”_, thesis Fig. performance_excess_air.

7. **Pressure effect: why steam quantity changes more than efficiency?**

- \(P\) shifts \(T*\mathrm{sat}\) and latent heat; affects \(\dot m*\mathrm{steam}\) for same duty.
- Efficiency changes are secondary over 4–16 bar in results.  
  Support: _“Parametric trends”_, thesis Fig. performance_drum_pressure and table.

8. **Fuel flow scaling: why near-linear duties/steam vs firing rate?**

- Available heat transfer area sufficient over 25–125% range; solver shows proportional \(Q\_\mathrm{useful}\).
- Slight efficiency drop at highest load indicates effectiveness limits.  
  Support: _“Parametric trends”_, thesis Fig. performance_fuel_flow.

9. **Fouling: why does downstream recovery degrade first?**

- Downstream stages already have smaller \(\Delta T\); added resistance reduces UA effectiveness more.
- Stack temperature rises (e.g., ~152°C → ~165°C at high fouling).  
  Support: _“Parametric trends”_, thesis Fig. performance_fouling.

10. **What would you do next to strengthen validation?**

- Instrumented boiler test: stack \(T\), O2/CO2, steam rate, feedwater \(T\), ΔP across economizer.
- Calibrate fouling/roughness and confirm stage-wise duty distribution.  
  Support: _“Conclusions & limitations”_.
